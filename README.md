# Are You Smarter Than a 00110101 Grader

This program is a single-page application meant to be a teaching tool for those learning a new coding language. The questions are based on methods used in a language and are specifically designed to make the user think and eventually master the basics.

The program tells you when you are right or wrong, and lets you know the correct answer if you get it wrong. It keeps track of the questions you have gotten correct or wrong, and at the end you are awarded a score based on how well you did.

The program will soon randomize and generate all answers dynamically rather than from a pre-seeded database. This means no two quizzes will ever be the same as each time you generate a new question it will be one of over 200,000 possibilities.

Try it out and get to learning!
